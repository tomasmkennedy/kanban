# Kanban Board with React

This project is my introduction and learning experience with React,
as I delve deeper into learning JavaScript and how it interacts
with frameworks. 

I used the React Dnd library to enable drag and drop 
functionality, and further expanded this by implementing 
touchscreen compatibility.

I learned quite a bit about React and its nuances, such as 
props, hooks, and states, as well as how to better use them
to my advantage. 

# Instructions

First, run 
```
  npm install
```
to download all necessary packages for the program.

After this, all you have to do is run
```
  npm start
```
Or if you are on mac (currently untested on windows), you 
can run 
```
  npm run electron-dev
```
To run a browserless version I have started working on using
ElectronJS
